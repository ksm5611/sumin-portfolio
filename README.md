# sumin-portfolio

This was a final project for the Web Development Bootcamp at Lighthouse Labs, created by [Sumin](https://github.com/ksm5611).

## Tech Stack

This app was used ReactJS, styled-components, Mui, bootstrap, react-type-animation, css for front-end and Python Django, sqlite3 for back-end.

## Running the project

You need **TWO** terminal windows/tabs for this (or some other plan for running django and react.js processes).

In the first terminal, `cd` into `sumin-portfolio`. Run `python3 -m venv venv` and `source venv/bin/activate` then ` pip install Django` to install the dependencies, then `python manage.py runserver` to launch the server.
In the second terminal, `cd` into ` my-app`. Run `npm install` to install the dependencies. Then run `npm start`, and go to `http://localhost:3000/` in your browser. From there, you can start exploring this app.
